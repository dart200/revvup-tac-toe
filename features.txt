Features I might like to include:
  - proper login support to rejoin games in progress
  - animation to designate win
  - dynamically scalable UI, right now the game-board is a state 600x600px
  - potentially leader boards
  - get TicTacToe/User type definitions from centralized place
  - missing error messages like game not found
