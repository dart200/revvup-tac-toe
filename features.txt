Features I might like to include:
  - proper login support, right now it just does anon logic, which lasts until you clear cookies
  - animation to designate win
  - dynamically scalable UI, right now the game-board is a static 600x600px
  - leader boards?
  - get TicTacToe/User type definitions/utility code from centralized place instead of having them
      copies between front end and back end;
  - missing error messages on such as game not found
  - scalability issues: this infrastructure will scale quite cheaply, though you probably would 
      want login and creation limits to prevent someone from creating excess costs
